            <h1>About Melissa</h1>
            <img src="" alt="picture of Melissa Allgeier">
            <p>My mom taught me to sew about 15 years ago and I'm SO thankful that she did. Sewing has brought me so much joy over the years and it's a such great feeling to produce something from nothing. The sense of accomplishment that comes from sewing is part of the reason I started this school. I want to bring that sense of accomplishment and confidence to a whole new generation of sewers. I think the art of sewing is a dying art and I want to do my part to keep the art alive. Please let me know if you have any questions about me or the school. I truly believe that ANYone can sew and I'm here to help you realize that!</p>
